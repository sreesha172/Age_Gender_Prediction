##Age Gender Prediction:

##project Overview:

The Age and Gender Prediction project aims to predict the age and gender of individuals from images. This project involves several steps: data collection, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation. The primary goal is to build a model that can accurately predict age and gender from facial images.The Age and Gender Prediction project involves building and deploying a deep learning model to predict age and gender from facial images. By following the outlined steps, you can create a robust system capable of making these predictions accurately. This project can have applications in various domains, such as security, social media, and personalized marketing.In this Python Project, I had used Deep Learning to accurately identify the gender and age of a person from a single image of a face. The predicted gender may be one of ‘Male’ and ‘Female’, and the predicted age may be one of the following ranges- (0 – 2), (4 – 6), (8 – 12), (15 – 20), (25 – 32), (38 – 43), (48 – 53), (60 – 100) (8 nodes in the final soft max layer). It is very difficult to accurately guess an exact age from a single image because of factors like makeup, lighting, obstructions, and facial expressions. And so, I made this a classification problem instead of making it one of regression.

##Steps:

1. Data Collection:

**Datasets:
-You can use publicly available datasets such as:
-UTK Face Dataset
-IMDB-WIKI Dataset
-For this python project, I had used the Adience dataset.This dataset is available in the public domain.This dataset serves as a benchmark for face photos and is inclusive of various real-world imaging conditions like noise, lighting, pose, and appearance. The images have been collected from Flickr albums and distributed under the Creative Commons (CC) license. It has a total of 26,580 photos of 2,284 subjects in eight age ranges (as mentioned above) and is about 1GB in size. The models I used had been trained on this dataset.

2. Data Preprocessing:

**Image Preprocessing
-Resize images.
-Normalize pixel values.

**Label Preprocessing:
-One-hot encode gender labels.
-Scale age labels (if necessary).

3.Model Building:

**CNN Architecture
-Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for predicting age and gender.

4. Model Training:

-Train the Model.
-Use the combined loss and metrics to train the model on age and gender predictions.

5.Model Evaluation:

**Evaluate the Model
-Assess the model's performance on the test set for both age and gender predictions.
